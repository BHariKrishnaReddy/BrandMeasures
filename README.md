## Overview
The code primarily focuses on 
        `audio-to-text conversion, text passed is to spell correction, and keyword extraction`.
However, it's important to note that this is just a part of the overall process of measuring the impact of a brand in the digital space. The impact of a brand can be measured in various ways, such as social media engagement metrics, website traffic, search engine rankings, sentiment analysis, and more. While the code you've seen may not directly measure these metrics, the extracted keywords and sentiment act as indicators of brand impact.

For example, if a particular brand is mentioned frequently and positively in online content, it can indicate a strong brand presence and positive impact. On the other hand, if a brand is mentioned frequently but with negative sentiment, it can indicate a need for brand reputation management.


## Installation
